# How did I do the markup for the project

## Initialization
I started off the project's initialization using Vue + Vite.
I had to install scss preprocessor to be able to follow BEM methodology which are really useful and easy going.
## First steps
As I used Vue for building this project I wanted to split all the site's blocks into components.
There was made a hierarchy where I would divide images for each block as well as I would do to components.
Each component represents a set of subcomponents and as a result they represent separate sections.
## Slider
Of course there was not no need to build a new slider by myself. So I used an existing, highly rated library which I've used before. 
The idea for the slider block was about placing an active slide in the center and making it slighter bigger then the others
## Images
For images which require either interaction with user or needed for logo I would use SVG format.
## Adaptation
The adaptation was clear in this case. I used dev tools when I was looking for break points.
